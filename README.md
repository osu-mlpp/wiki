# MLpp wiki
This project and wiki are still ongoing projects.

This project aims at improving the player ranking system of osu! by providing a more accurate evaluation of difficulty of beatmaps and player scores than ppv2, using statistics first and then using machine learning to interpolate and predict those statistics on newer and less played beatmaps.

Please start by checking out the [Summary](Summary.md) for a more in depth explanation.
