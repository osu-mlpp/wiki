# MLpp (Machine Learning performance points) system proposal
## project goals / general idea

**TODO** (highest prio)

In this project, we aim to create a "good" pp algorythm with the use of statistics and machine learning.  
Statistics on player scores on beatmaps (and on beatmaps patterns from player replays) will be used to generate the training and testing sets to train a neural network that takes a beatmap data (or some pattern specific data) as input (with some preprocessing, but no statistics) and outputs data that allows us to have a good estimate of the pp values of scores.

## Note about v2, modes and mods

**TODO** (high prio)

## Note about values considered in scores (only max-combo, acc and miss-counts ?)

**TODO** (high prio)
